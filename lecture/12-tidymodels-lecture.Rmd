# tidymodels
- `tidymodels` is a __collection of packages__
- each package is targeted at a specific part of the modelling process

# Overview of tidymodels packages:

.pull-left[

## Goal of each package:

1. __`rsamples`__ - to split the data into training and testing-sets
2. __`recipes`__ - to prepare the data with pre-processing
3. __`parsnip`__ - to specify and fit a model to the data
4. __`yardstick`__ and `tune` - to evaluate model performance
5. `workflows` - to combine `recipe` and `parsnip` objects into a workflow 
6. `tune` and `dials` - to optimize models  
7. `broom` - to increase the readability of model output
8. ...

# Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- __Data needs to be clean__
- Data needs to adhere to some model-specific rules and assumptions

--

> __Feature Engineering__
> The process of transforming raw data into features well suited-for modelling.

--

- What does this entail?
    - Removing `NA`'s -> how to deal with them? Throw data away? Impute with mean/median/...?
    - Transform numeric values (`log`, `sqrt`,...)
    - Re-scale numeric values
    - Deal with nominal/string values
    - ....
---
# Pre-Processing with _recipes_

- While all of this can be coded by hand, `recipes` make our life's easier by providing the necessary operations in a __standardized__ way
- Feels familiar to `tidyverse` users and is compatible with `dplyr` 

.large-code[

```r
recipe(outcome ~ ., data = training_data) %>%
      # remove features with high correlation between them
      step_corr(all_predictors()) %>%
      step_string2factor(all_string_predictors()) %>%
      step_impute_mean(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
      step_mutate(<dplyr call>)
```
]

--

- Can be reused easily, as we can rely on roles/types and not specific variable names
--

- Use
    - __`prep()`__ to calculate pre-processing parameters (e.g., mean to impute)
    - __`bake()`__ to apply the pre-processing steps to the actual data
---
name: Rsample

# Splitting Your Data-Set with _rsample_

.pull-left[
Useful to split your data into __testing__ and __training__ subsets:

### Why do we care?

- Model should explain the data, not memorize it
- Having multiple splits allows us to construct and compare different models with different (combinations of) parameters
<!-- QUESTION: The following two points I do not understand - fitting the final model multiple times would not change the outcome, no? -->
<!-- Does this in the end mean the same thing as the first point I sneakily added? -->
- The final model is only used on the test set once, so we want to make sure that the final model is the best way of explaining the data.
  - If we run multiple models on the test set, we start to optimize our model to the test set instead of focusing on the model's general ability to explain the data-set.

# Different Ways of Splitting Your Data-Set

.pull-left[
- Initial split (__training__ vs __testing__)
```r
initial_split(
    dataset,
    prop = 0.x,
    strata = <desired column>)
```
- Cross Validation and V-fold
- Bootstraps
- Rolling Forecast

# Cross Validation and V-fold

.pull-left[
- The data is split into `v`-sets of data called __folds__ of equal size.  
- Function: `vfold_cv(dataset, v = x)`
  - E.g., `x = 3`, the data is split in three different ways with 2/3 in analysis en 1/3 is assessment.
  - The default is set to 10, this is still manageable but enough to produce robust results. 
- Output is a `tibble` containing `lists`, each list contains information on how the data is split.
  - We can unpack the first column to get our analysis and assessment set. 
- For more information and variants of cross validation check out: [Tidy Modelling with R Ch 10](https://www.tmwr.org/resampling).

# Bootstrapping

.pull-left[
- Analysis sets are sampled from data-set **with** replacement.
  - Has the same size as the initial data-set
- Analysis vs Assessment (Out-of-the bag) split
<!-- QUESTION: Is this a rhetoric remark?  -->
  - Why does the assessment set differ in size?
- Function: `bootstraps(dataset, times = x)`

# Rolling Forecasting Origing Resampling

.pull-left[
- If our data-set has a __temporal__ component, simply random sampling can disrupt the model in estimating patterns.
  - Solution:</br>
  `fit_resamples(formula, resamples, ...)`
- We set the size of the analysis and assessment sets. The first sample follows this division, the second iteration takes the same data size but shifts by a specified number.

# Modelling in R

- Many different models to choose from
    - Type of model to use is an important decision, which needs to grounded __in theory__
- For each type of model, multiple implementations are available
---
# Modelling in R

- Consider these examples for linear regression models:

- `stat::lm()`
```r
lm(formula, data, [...], ...)
```
--

- `glmnet::glm()`
```r
glmnet(x, y, [...], standardize = TRUE, intercept = TRUE, ...)
```
--

- `sparklyr::ml_linear_regression()`
```r
ml_linear_regression(x, formula = NULL, fit_intercept = TRUE, [...], standardization = TRUE, [...], ...)
```
---
# Modelling in R
.pull-left[
- Syntax differs
    - in argument order
    - in argument names
    - ...

.pull-right[
- __`parsnip` to the rescue__!

# parsnip

- Package that aims to unify signatures of different models in `R`
- One familiar approach to **many different types of models**
    - [Searchable list](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/) of all models available through `parsnip`

.large-code[
```
  linear_reg() %>% 
      set_engine("lm") %>% 
      fit(dependent ~ pred_one + pred_two, data = data)
```
]
--

- `linear_reg()`, `decision_tree()`, `logistic_reg()`, ...
- `set_engine` to specify which implementation to use
- Unified way of fitting a model to a data-set: __`fit()`__
- Unified way of predicting the outcome on a data-set: __`predict(fitted_model, data)`__

# Regression Metrics

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
$$
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
$$

#### Root Mean Squared Error
$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} \
$$

#### R squared
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Define the formula in LaTeX format
latex_formula <- "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}"

# Output the LaTeX formula with custom styling
knitr::asis_output(sprintf("<div class='large-center'>$$ %s $$</div>", latex_formula))
```

- $n$ = Number of observations
- $y_i$ = Actual value for observation $i$
- $\hat{y}_i$ = Predicted value for observation $i$
- $\bar{y}$ = Mean of the dependent variable
