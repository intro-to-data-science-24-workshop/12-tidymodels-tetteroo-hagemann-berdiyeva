# **Rsample** package
.pull-left[
Useful to split your data into testing and training subsets:

Why do we care? 
- Having multiple splits allows us to construct and compare different models with different (combinations of) parameters.
- The final model is only used on the test set once, so we want to make sure that the final model is the best way of explaining the data.
  - If we run multiple models on the test set, we start to optimise our model to the test set instead of focusing on the model's general ability to explain the dataset.

# **Different ways of splitting your dataset**

- Initial split (training vs testing) --> initial_split(strata = desired column, prop = 0.x)
- V-fold
- Bootstraps
- Rolling forecast

# Bootstrapping

.pull-left[
- Analysis sets are sampled from training dataset **with** replacement.
  - Has the same size as the training dataset
- Analysis vs Assessment (Out-of-the bag) split
  - Why does the assessment set differ in size?
- Function: bootstraps(dataset, times = x).

- (insert picture from practice example to show output of a bootstrap)

# Rolling Forecasting Origing Resampling
.pull-left[
- If our dataset has a temporal component, simply random sampling can disrupt the model in estimating patterns.
  - Solution: fit_resamples(formula, resamples, ...)
- We set the size of the analysis and assessment sets. The first sample follows this division, the second iteration takes the same data size but shifts by a specified number. 
- Alternatively we don't have to shift by one day but also by one week or more.

# Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- Data needs to adhere to some model-specific rules and assumptions

> __Feature Engineering__
> The process of transforming raw data into features well suited-for modelling.

- What does this entail?
    - removing NA's -> how to deal with them? Throw data away? Impute with mean/median/...?
    - Transform numeric values (`log`, `sqrt`,...)
    - Rescale numeric values
    - deal with nominal/string values
    
---
# Pre-processing with recipes

- While all of this can be coded by hand, `recipes` make our life's easier by providing the necessary operations in a standardized way
- familiar to `tidyverse` users and compatible with `dplyr` 
```r
rec <- recipe(predictor ~ ., data = training_data) %>%
      step_corr(all_predictors()) %>% # remove features with high correlation between them
      step_string2factor(all_string_predictors()) %>%
      step_impute_mean(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
      step_mutate(<dplyr call>)
```
--
- can be reused easily, as we can rely on roles and not specific variable names
--
<br>
- Use
    - `prep()` to calculate pre-processing parameters (e.g., mean to impute)
    - `bake()` to apply the pre-processing steps to the actual data
---
# Modelling in R

- Many different models to choose from
    - Type of model to use is an important decision, which needs to grounded __in theory__
- For each type of model, multiple implementations are available
- Consider these examples for linear regression models:
---
# Modelling in R

- `stat::lm()`
```r
lm(formula, data, [...], ...)
```
--

- `glmnet::glm()`
```r
glmnet(x, y, [...], standardize = TRUE, intercept = TRUE, ...)
```
--

- `sparklyr::ml_linear_regression()`
```r
ml_linear_regression(x, formula = NULL, fit_intercept = TRUE, [...], standardization = TRUE, [...], ...)
```
---
# Modelling in R
.pull-left[
- Syntax differs
    - in argument order
    - in argument names
    - (in output formatting/reporting -> __later__)

- Parsnip to the rescue!

# parsnip

- package that aims to unify signatures of different models in `R`
- one familiar approach to **many different types of models**

```
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  fit(dependent ~ pred_one + pred_two, data = data)
```
--
<br>
- `linear_reg()`, `decision_tree()`, `logistic_reg()`, ...
- `set_engine` to specify which implementation to use
- unified way of fitting a model to a dataset: `fit()`
- unified way of predicting the outcome on a dataset: `predict(fitted_model, data)`
