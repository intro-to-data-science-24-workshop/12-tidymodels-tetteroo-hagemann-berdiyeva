# Introduction

This session is designed to guide you through the entire modelling process to familiarize yourself with some of the power of the packages in `tidymodels`. 

We will cover:

- splitting your data-set into a training and a test set using `rsample`,
- pre-processing your data-set using `recipes`,
- fitting a model using `parsnip`,
- and finally evaluate the performance of the model using `yardstick`.

For those of you attending this session live - stay tuned, as __there will be a price to be won in the end__!

⚠️ __Attention__

Modelling is an extremely complex topic. Choosing an appropriate model for a specific task requires theoretical deliberation and careful consideration of the data at hand. As was seen in the lecture, hand-picking specific model configurations can rightfully be criticized and requires justification grounded in theory.

All of these are outside of the scope of this workshop - we aim at giving you a glimpse on how to use selected `R` packages. Doing so in a very condensed fashion requires us to take some shortcuts and trade-offs. Please be mindful of this when consulting this material for your future modelling adventures - there's a lot of more to think about!

# Example.
    
1. Loading and transforming the data with recipe


2. Sampling & bootstrapping


3. Model creation


4. Evaluation



```{r eval = FALSE}
# parsnip model ALWAYS returns the results as a data frame 
predictions <- bind_cols(
  select(auto_test, mpg),
  predict(model, auto_test)
)

# And here comes yardstick
# When "truth" is a factor: accuracy and the Kappa
# When "truth" is numeric: rmse, rsq and mae.

# Estimate one or more common performance estimates depending on the class of truth 
metrics(predictions, truth = older, estimate = .pred)

# Regression metrics
reg_metrics <- metric_set(huber_loss, iic, mape, mase)

# The returned function has the same arguments as metrics()
reg_metric(predictions, truth = mpg, estimate = .pred)

```


# Exercise.

1. Loading and transforming the data with recipe


2. Sampling & bootstrapping


3. Model creation


4. Evaluation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# TO BE CORRECTED!!!

predictions_lm <- bind_cols(
 select(auto_test, mpg),
 predict(linreg_reg_model, auto_test)
)

# One or more common performance estimates
# metrics(data= YOUR CODE, truth = YOUR CODE, estimate = YOUR CODE)

# Calculate symmetric mean absolute percentage error
# Who has the lowest value?

# Answer: smape(predictions_lm, truth = mpg, estimate = .pred)

# OR

# Calculate the coefficient of determination (the traditional one)
# Who has the highest value?

# Answer: rsq_trad(predictions_lm, truth = mpg, estimate = .pred)
```




## demo on how to make tabs! {.tabset}

#### test tabbing
including `{.tabset}` next to a heading will make all subheadings (one level presumably) into tabs

#### give me tabs!
to cancel it just put a higher order heading

### content after tabs
